**context-set-extended-version** contains a collection of contexts used for evaluating the dirichlet based null models

**experiments-clojure-code** contains the clojure code used to generate the jar file

results-100.csv contains the results obtained from null model generation for the collection of contexts above.

process-csv.py and all-svg-to-pdf are used to generate the graphics and tables for the paper.
