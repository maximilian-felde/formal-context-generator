# README

### Contents

This repository contains supplementary material for a paper on random generation of formal contexts using dirichlet distributions.

**dirichlet_random_contexts** contains a python file with the random context generator based on dirichlet distributions.

**contexts_to_pictures** contains the clojure code that was used to compute the intents and pseudo-intents of the random contexts.

**generated_contexts** contains the contexts files that were generated in order to empirically evaluate the Dirichlet approach for random context generation as zip packed csvs.

**imitate_contexts** contains clojure code that was used to test the application of the dirichlet random context approach for null models, i.e., to generate similar contexts to some given reference context.

**extended_version** contains code / data / results for the extended version of the paper on random generation of formal contexts with dirichlet distributions. The extended version deals with null model generation for formal contexts using the dirichlet generator.
